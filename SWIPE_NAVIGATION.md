# 👆 Swipe Navigation Feature

## Overview
The app now includes intuitive swipe gesture navigation that allows users to move between tabs by swiping left or right anywhere on the screen.

## How It Works

### 🎯 Swipe Directions
- **Swipe Left** → Navigate to the next tab (rightward in tab order)
- **Swipe Right** → Navigate to the previous tab (leftward in tab order)

### 📱 Tab Order
1. **Home** (Products listing)
2. **Wishlist** (Saved items)
3. **Cart** (Shopping cart)
4. **Explore** (Discovery)

### 🎨 Visual Feedback

#### First-Time User Guide
- **Swipe Indicator**: Appears on first app launch showing "Swipe to navigate" with animated arrows
- **Auto-dismiss**: Disappears after animation or user interaction
- **One-time**: Only shows once per app installation

#### Real-Time Feedback
- **Edge Indicators**: Red bars appear on left/right edges when swiping
- **Color Tint**: Subtle red background tint during swipe gestures
- **Tab Position Dots**: Bottom indicator showing current tab position
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration when successfully navigating between tabs

### ⚙️ Technical Implementation

#### Components Created
1. **SwipeNavigationWrapper**: Main gesture handler with navigation logic
2. **SwipeIndicator**: First-time user tutorial overlay
3. **SwipeEdgeIndicator**: Visual feedback on screen edges
4. **TabPositionIndicator**: Current tab position dots

#### Key Features
- **Threshold-based Navigation**: Requires 25% screen width swipe or high velocity
- **Smooth Animations**: Spring-based transitions with proper damping
- **AsyncStorage Integration**: Remembers if user has seen the tutorial
- **Haptic Feedback**: Uses Expo Haptics for tactile response
- **Gesture Constraints**: Prevents excessive swipe beyond reasonable limits

### 🔧 Dependencies Used
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: Pan gesture detection
- `react-native-reanimated`: Smooth animations and interpolations
- `expo-haptics`: Tactile feedback
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: Tutorial state persistence

### 🚀 Usage Tips
- **Natural Gestures**: Swipe anywhere on the screen
- **Quick Navigation**: Fast swipes work with less distance
- **Visual Cues**: Watch for edge indicators and tab dots
- **Smooth Experience**: Navigation includes spring animations

### 🎯 User Experience Benefits
- **Faster Navigation**: Quick gesture-based tab switching
- **Intuitive Interface**: Natural swipe behavior users expect
- **Visual Learning**: Clear indicators teach the feature
- **Accessibility**: Works alongside traditional tab bar navigation
- **Performance**: Optimized animations with native gesture handling

The swipe navigation enhances the app's usability by providing a modern, gesture-based navigation experience while maintaining the familiar tab bar for traditional navigation preferences.
